# Baby Keylogger in Python

This is a simple keylogger built using Python and the pynput library.  
It records every key pressed on the keyboard and saves them into a file called log.txt.



## Features

- Captures and logs all key presses
- Saves keystrokes to a local file
- Minimal code, easy to understand
- Great for learning about keyboard hooks and basic hacking concepts


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pynput library

### Install pynput (for Debian-based systems)

`bash
pip install pynput [--break-system-packages[if not using virtul env]]

Or use a virtual environment to avoid system-level issues.
