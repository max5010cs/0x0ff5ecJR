## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a roadmap and progress tracker for my hacking journey. The core objective is to actively develop, test, and improve tools related to bug hunting, malware development, and cybersecurity projects. The content here is split into the following folders:

>>>>>>>>>>>

### 🐞 bug_hunting/
Contains tools, scripts, and notes related to bug bounty programs and vulnerability discovery. Here, you'll find:
- Recon scripts: Custom scripts for scanning, subdomain enumeration, and vulnerability testing.
- Bug reports: Submissions to platforms like HackerOne, complete with PoCs.
- Automation tools: Tools developed to automate reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery.



### 🔧 projects/
This is the space where I build tools to enhance my skillset and contribute to the cybersecurity community. Projects here will range from:
- Security tools: Port scanners, fuzzers, vulnerability scanners.
- Scripts and utilities: Anything from Python automation to custom payloads.
- Personal tools: Custom software created for use in my journey and beyond.

## 🚀 Roadmap to Mastery

### Year 1: Core Skills and Bug Hunting Focus
My first year revolves around mastering Python, C, and C++, with a particular focus on automating security testing, creating malware simulations, and participating in bug bounty programs.

Key Objectives:
- Automating recon tasks using Python.
- Learning malware basics and reverse engineering.
- Actively contributing to bug bounty programs.

The goal is to complete a series of practical projects and participate in challenges to reinforce my learning, testing my knowledge through real-world scenarios.

### Year 2 and Beyond: Specializing in Malware Development and Reverse Engineering
My next goal is to refine my knowledge in low-level programming (C, C++, Assembly), understanding system vulnerabilities, and creating stealth malware, alongside reverse engineering real-world threats.

Focus Areas:
- Malware development: Creating modular RATs, encrypted payloads, and more.
- Reverse engineering: Analyzing malware, writing decoders, and evasion techniques.
- Exploit development: Learning advanced techniques, building advanced exploits, and creating my own PoCs for vulnerabilities.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## 🎯 Goals for This Repo
- Build a comprehensive toolkit for bug hunting and automated recon.
- Master malware analysis and development.
- Contribute tools and resources to the community.
- Continuously push my skills and knowledge with challenging projects.
