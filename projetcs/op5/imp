Encrypted Victory. Deployed

# ShadowTalk

**Encrypted One-to-One Chatroom — Fully Private, Peer-Key Based**

ShadowTalk is a web-based chatroom system that prioritizes **complete privacy**. It’s designed for one-to-one communication using **end-to-end encryption** in the browser — with the encryption keys never touching the server.

> "Motivated by criminals, Jack, Victor, and Mr. Eggs."

## 🚀 Features

* 🧩 **Frontend encryption** only — the server never sees plain-text messages
* 🔐 **Client-shared encryption key** — shared via Telegram, in person, etc.
* 🧠 **No authentication**, usernames, or email — just room ID and secret key
* 🔄 **Real-time messaging** via WebSockets
* 🌐 **Deployed via Vercel (frontend)** and **Render (backend)**

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Create a Room**
   Generates a random 6-character Room ID and a 256-bit base64 key.

2. **Share the Key Securely**
   You send your friend the Room ID and Key *outside* the platform (Telegram, etc).

3. **Join the Room**
   Enter the Room ID and Key — if both match, you're in.

4. **Start Messaging**
   All messages are encrypted on the client, sent via WebSocket, and decrypted only by the peer.

## 🔒 Security Principles

* **End-to-end encryption** via AES-GCM
* **Encryption key never leaves the browser**
* **Backend only relays messages** — stateless, no logs, no metadata
* **Minimal attack surface**

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/frontend   → React + Vite + TypeScript UI
/backend    → Node.js WebSocket relay server
```

---

## 🧪 Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:5173`

---

## 🚢 Deployment

* Frontend → Vercel (with `/frontend` as root)
* Backend → Render (Web Service)

Ensure your frontend WebSocket client uses:

```ts
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://your-backend.onrender.com");
```
