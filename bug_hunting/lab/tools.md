## shodan
Shodan is a specialized search engine that lets users find devices and systems connected to the internet. Unlike Google, which indexes websites, Shodan scans the internet for IP addresses and reveals what kinds of devices are publicly accessible—such as webcams, servers, routers, industrial control systems, and more. It shows information like open ports, services running, software versions, and potential vulnerabilities. Security professionals use Shodan to identify exposed systems, assess risks, and monitor their infrastructure. It’s a powerful tool for cybersecurity, but also highlights how many devices are left unprotected online.

## Have I Been Pwned
Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) does one thing; it tells you if an email address has appeared in a leaked data breach. Finding one’s email within leaked data indicates leaked private information and, more importantly, passwords. Many users use the same password across multiple platforms, if one platform is breached, their password on other platforms is also exposed. Indeed, passwords are usually stored in encrypted format; however, many passwords are not that complex and can be recovered using a variety of attacks.

## Censys
At first glance, Censys appears similar to Shodan. However, Shodan focuses on Internet-connected devices and systems, such as servers, routers, webcams, and IoT devices. Censys, on the other hand, focuses on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets. Some of its use cases include enumerating domains in use, auditing open ports and services, and discovering rogue assets within a network. You might want to check Censys Search Use Cases.
